#### Phase 1 Goal
Get a working Wallet that can do the very basics of the following.

- Open Wallet using WalletFile, Secret Key
- View XLM Transactions

- View Balance of XLM Asset

Once the above features are completed and we have reached MVP a secondary project will be created to work on adding more features.

*This project is still in the conceptual phase, follow the project to keep up to date as we begin to make progress.  The goal is to create one of the most attractive, beautiful and functional Stellar Wallets for Windows 10.  It will be available via the Windows 10 Store and will focus very heavily on Fluent Design elements.*
