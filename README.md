A wallet for the Stellar Network

## Status
### Development phase

Minimum Viable Product for the first release.

#### Phase 1 Goal
Get a working Wallet that can do the very basics of the following.

- Open Wallet using WalletFile, Secret Key
- View XLM Transactions
- Send XLM Asset
- View Balance of XLM Asset

#### Wallet Guidelines
Stellar has released new guidelines for Wallets, you can read more about them [here](
https://www.stellar.org/lumens/wallets/wallet-listing-guidelines/#completeguidelines).  This wallet will comply and go beyond these wallet requirements.  We also plan on getting multiple audits of the code system. 


Once the above features are completed and we have reached MVP a secondary project will be created to work on adding more features.
